                    I'm very proud of this project as throughout the semester I was able to implement NPCs, battle, terrain generation, and more!

                    of the game. I wanted to do something similar with the SCP wiki, thus I have created a curses based TUI that scrapes information from

                    it hammered in the fundementals of C++ with pointers, ncurses, and implementing powerful algorithms to accomplish the projects requirements.
                    I'm very proud of this project as throughout the semester I was able to implement NPCs, battle, terrain generation, and more!</span>
